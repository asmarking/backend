backend stuff

MyPriorityQueue implementation uses MyMinHeap backend. Our underlying data structure is a min-heap, 
so smaller elements (in the compareTo() sense) have higher priorities. The root node of the min-heap 
is the one with the highest priority and is also the smallest element in the min-heap.
